        <p>For most of my professional and academic career so far, I was heading down a dramatically different path than the one I am on now. I studied philosophy and Arabic in college and had plans to depart with the Peace Corps in 2020, preparing to teach English abroad later in my career. But something was missing; I never quite felt the spark.</p>
        <p>However, it was through my philosophy degree that I found my interest and later passion for programming and software development. Through studying formal logic and reasoning, I found something I was both quite good at and enjoyed thoroughly: solving complex logical problems. I began thinking about careers where these skills might be put to use.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until I spoke with a friend who works in the CS field that I realized there was potential for me there. After all, how would a philosophy student know anything about developing software? I began studying fervently my first programming language, Python, and used many of the online and free resources available in order to build a solid foundational knowledge before applying to a full stack course through Kickstart Coding.</p>
        <p>I am always studying new topics within software development, and spend the rest of my time working on projects such as Python scripts to help with day to day tasks, and building professional portfolios for friends. I look forward to working in web development</p>
