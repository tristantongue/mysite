          <p><blockquote class="blockquote">This essay won the Michigan State University Philosophy Department's Best Undergraduate Essay of the Year in 2020. I examine the concept of beauty as it relates to the human experience through comparing and contrasting the 19th century philosophers, Freidrich Schiller and Arthur Schopenhauer. This will also be edited further and published in MSU's undergraduate philosophy journal, Elenchus.</blockquote></p>
          <p>At first glance, the theories and ideas advanced by Friedrich Schiller and Arthur Schopenhauer in On the Aesthetic Education of Man and The World as Will and Representation, respectively, have little in common. Broadly, Schiller presents a social critique of his time and Schopenhauer offers a metaphysical account of the world, with no interest in historical events. But a closer read shows where their ideas overlap, where they contradict, and where they are compatible. Through an exploration of their respective views on the human condition, including the relation between subjects and objects, and the metaphysical forces that act upon us, there emerges a common importance. This importance is the value of art and its content, beauty. While the reasons for emphasizing the individual’s experience of art differ between Schiller and Schopenhauer, the two views ultimately resonate with each other. That is, both recognize the significance of an aesthetic experience. The ways in which the experience influences the individual are different according to each man, Schiller views the experience as character enhancing while for Schopenhauer it is an experience of pure contemplation. By examining each stage of an aesthetic experience, such as, from what conditions does a subject transcend from to the state of mind it allows, and what comprises the content of an aesthetic experience, beauty, we will see that for both Schiller and Schopenhauer aesthetic experience is the most crucial human experience.</p>
          <p>On the Aesthetic Education of Man begins with a diagnosis of newly enlightened European society. Schiller saw the replacement of absolute monarchies with democratic republics as representative of a great problem, “physical society cannot cease to exist for a moment while moral society is forming as an idea” (8). The thought is that the newfound moral and universal values promoted by the doctrines of new republics would not have the necessary support to become the values of actual society, and this has consequences for the continuation of society in its aim to transcend the natural state of man. The case in point that motivated this view was the Reign of Terror, where the newfound liberal ideas of the first republic were subsumed by the violence and suffering that occurred en masse. Here, it is crucial to point out that this failure of society Schiller attributes to the failure of the state to realize itself as a whole comprised of many individual parts (12). In other words, the failure of society’s moral order is the result of the undeveloped moral character of each of its citizens. It is from this framework that Schiller advances a theoretical understanding of character and a remedy to refine it, his endeavor is an ethical one.
          </p>
          <p>The suffering that Schopenhauer identifies is not the suffering of a specific historical event, it is the suffering of human existence. Suffering is the most immediate object in human life (Schopenhauer 1), the life of the individual is a perpetual struggle, calamity awaits us all (2). This view, that suffering is the defining factor of human existence, is pessimistic but accurate. The amount of suffering throughout history, human and otherwise, is truly unimaginable. As Schopenhauer puts it, “The world is just a hell and in it human beings are the tortured souls on the one hand, and the devils on the other” (11). For the individual, suffering and pain are felt ever so more strongly than happiness. This is another accurate point, we don’t rejoice for “the three greatest blessings of life as such, namely health, youth, and freedom, as long as we possess them, but only after we have lost them” (26). Another illustrative example of this phenomena is the expression, “it feels worse to lose than it does good to win.” The explanation Schopenhauer provides for this is human perception. All that is good is felt very minimally as the absence of pain, whereas all that is bad is felt immediately and obviously (2), experience is mediated by the degree of pain present. If we accept that our existence is happiest when we perceive the least, then “it follows that it would be better not to have it” (26). Nonetheless, we go on suffering in this world. But what dictates that we notice mostly unpleasant and painful things? What drives us to continue suffering? The answer is the will.
          </p>
          <p>Schopenhauer’s metaphysical account of the world starts with the recognition of the existence of objects in the world, but “every object always and eternally presupposes a subject, and thus remains representation” (60). Due to the subjective nature of our perception, the world as we know it can only ever be a representation which conceals from us the real nature of things. However, he posits, “We want to know the significance of those representations; we ask whether this world is nothing more than representation … Or we ask whether it is something else, something in addition, and if so what that something is” (64). The answer that all the world is representation just doesn’t satisfy us, as it somehow doesn’t fit with our experience as individuals. If we acknowledge our existence as bodied individuals in the world, we find our “knowledge, which is the conditional supporter of the whole world as representation, is nevertheless given entirely through the medium of a body” (65). The connection between an individual and his body is thus an intimate and necessary one. To illustrate this, Schopenhauer suggests a scenario in which the individual’s body appears to the individual as incomprehensible as any other object in the world, the inner nature of his body’s actions and mechanisms seem as equally strange as all other objects of perception. “All this, however, is not the case,” concludes Schopenhauer (65). This is somewhat obvious; we know ourselves unlike we know any other object in the world. The immediate knowledge of our own existence is what Schopenhauer denotes as will.</p>
          <p>The intimacy an individual knows in regards to his actions is due to the one-one relation between his body and his will. Schopenhauer states, “The action of the body is nothing but the act of will objectified” (66). Equally, “every impression on the body is also at once and directly an impression on the will” (66). It is will and will alone that allows individuals a unique understanding of their behavior and inner life. It is also will that explains man’s fundamental capacity to suffer, “it is called pain when it is contrary to the will, and gratification or pleasure when in accordance with the will” (66). </p>
          <p>In returning to the question of how to understand reality, the knowledge afforded to us by the will, knowledge that gives an understanding of both our subjectivity and objectivity, Schopenhauer takes to be the most fundamental and direct knowledge available in providing any sort of metaphysical account. Therefore, “we shall use it further as a key to the inner being of every phenomenon in nature” (71). Not only does a subject have a will, but all other objects that appear as mere representations also have in them the will (71). This is what causes the inner nature of other objects to remain mysterious to us, as although they have in them their own will, a subject can only ever know his own will (67). So although will mediates the relation between a subject and his corresponding object, will is also mediated by the body. Any understanding of an object’s inner nature is therefore confined to the subject’s understanding of his own individuality. It follows, then, that if we are to gain any understanding of things as they are in themselves, we must leave our individuality behind. Which is, due to the link between will and the body, to leave the will behind. An aesthetic experience is the means to achieving this pure knowledge.</p>
          <p>For Schiller, an aesthetic experience is a means of improving an individual’s moral character that is unbalanced. The notion of character is situated within the discussion of mankind’s sensuous and rational nature. Humans are material beings in a material world, yet we have the capacity to develop abstract ideas that are as equally influential as material forces. By acknowledging mankind’s physical existence, Schiller recognizes the “material impulse” (41) which acts through the sense and is responsible for pleasure seeking behaviors. If an individual is dominated by the material impulse he is ruled by sensation and “his personality is suspended” (42), he does nothing but feel. Fundamentally, it is “this material impulse to which the entire phenomenon of mankind is ultimately bound” (42). Although not states by Schiller directly, this is nature’s impulse. The impulse that finds its ground in man’s rational nature is labeled the “formal impulse” (42). This impulse has no interest in particularities, but rather, “it insists upon truth and right” (43). For this reason, it might also be called the philosopher’s impulse. Domination by the formal impulse results in the cessation of individuality and an elevation “into a unity of ideas that comprehend the entire realm of phenomena” (44). This is the first intersecting point to make note of, as it rings the same tune as Schopenhauer’s overall project. A departure from individuality Schopenhauer takes to be crucial for understanding the inner nature of reality, and an aesthetic experience is the means to do this. However, due to the different nature of Schiller’s project, developing a moral character, individuality is a necessary aspect of an aesthetic experience.</p>
          <p>Schiller clearly thinks that universal principles are not enough to advance a true from of humanity. He asks, “How can we be true to such praiseworthy maxims as being just, kindly, and humane to others if we lack the capacity to accept alien nature into ourselves truly and faithfully … to make the feelings of others our own?” (48) The ability to recognize individuals and their particular experiences, to empathize with others, is equally as important. Likewise, without principles and laws, we would succumb to material desires. In order for an individual to have “complete perception of his humanity” (50) he cannot satisfy just one of the impulses, rather, the simultaneous experience of both impulses. This could only occur in an experience of a new impulse in which both the sensuous and the formal occur (51), Schiller calls this the playful impulse. Only through the experience of the playful impulse can mankind’s sensuous-rational nature be harmonized, and a balanced moral character develop. Accordingly, as each of the impulses attempt to realize their respective objects, so does the playful impulse. The object of the material impulse is all matter present to the senses, or life. The object of the formal impulse is all formal properties, or form. In combining these objects through the playful impulse, there emerges “living form: a concept serving to characterize all aesthetic properties of phenomena, what is in a word most generally called beauty” (53). Interestingly enough, beauty is a necessary condition for the existence of mankind. As only through the experience of beauty can mankind’s sensuous-rational nature be allowed to flourish (54). Without this capacity to experience the beautiful, mankind’s nature would be fundamentally different.</p>
          <p>Schiller claims that beauty is the consummation of humanity (54). As we have seen, true humanity can neither be confined to sensation nor thought. It follows, then, that beauty is neither strictly material perception nor is it strictly an idea. Ideal beauty is a pure balance of the concrete and the abstract, a material idea. The idea is felt and the matter is intellectualized. For Schiller, this is the greatest expression of humanity.</p>
          <p>We’ll recall that Schopenhauer’s project is to gain a more fundamental knowledge of reality. Will gives us an intimate understanding of our own existence and is fundamental to all objects, but confines us to our own bodies. Nonetheless, we can still gain knowledge of the inner nature of other objects in the world. This is achieved through exposure to the Idea, which is described as “the adequate objectivity of the will” (81). In order to comprehend the existence of a particular object, a subject must come to know the eternal form of it. To do this, the subject must use pure perception to let the object fill his consciousness and allow a contemplative state of mind. Individuality and will must be forgotten so that all that remains is perceiving subject and the perceived object (79-80). Perhaps confusing at first, the subject comes to know the Idea without the use of abstract thought. This appears to be a contradiction, as abstract thought seems necessary for the understanding of an object separate from its physical existence. However, it is only through pure perception that the subject’s entire consciousness can be filled by the object, resulting in the unity of perceiver and perceived. The subject is now “pure will-less, painless, timeless subject of knowledge” (80).
          </p>
          <p>This departure from individuality is at stark odds with Schiller, whose conception of an aesthetic experience has in it the recognition of the individual. Not only that, but what Schopenhauer identifies as a means to leave individuality, perception through the senses, Schiller takes to be what gives us our individuality. The material impulse is guided by sensation, and is what grounds an individual in his physical existence. For Schiller, it is domination by the formal impulse, which is characterized by abstract thought, that leads to the departure from individuality. Most likely, what accounts for this contradiction are their ontological assumptions about what is fundamental in the world, Ideas are not abstract knowledge for Schopenhauer. Under Schopenhauer’s theory, it is will that is most fundamental to existence, and will that is responsible for our individuality. Only in freedom from will can a subject hope to gain any fundamental knowledge, as it is our existence as willed individuals that creates the world as representation. Perception can free the subject from will by allowing a contemplation of an object unclouded by preconceived relations towards the object. </p>
          <p>For Schopenhauer, it is not history or science that communicate any fundamental knowledge, it is only art, the work of genius (86-87). Schopenhauer has great praise for the artist due his ability to discover eternal Ideas and communicate them (Vandenabeele 195). However, it is not beauty that is an Idea. What makes art beautiful is its capacity to deliver the knowledge of an Idea, “a beautiful flower is not beautiful because it expresses the Idea of beauty, but because it expresses the Idea of the flower” (Vandenabeele 195-196). An aesthetic experience is thus an opportunity to perceive “a Platonic Idea in and through a particular object” (Vandenabeele 196). Drastically different from the Platonic belief that Ideas are not perceptible by the senses, Schopenhauer definitively claims that Ideas are revealed through artworks in aesthetic experiences (Vandenabeele 196). Crucially, an aesthetic experience is the contemplation of an Idea in a meditative type experience. This does not “offer ultimate satisfaction for our restless desire as freedom from the thralldom of endless blind willing,” rather, the pleasure that arises from an aesthetic state of mind, a will-less state of mind, is the result of our desire “momentarily stilled instead of definitively fulfilled” (Vandenabeele 197). These contemplative experiences are very important for Schopenhauer’s philosophy, as only through the experience of beauty can a subject come to understand an Idea. Which is the closest one can ever get to understanding what is fundamental to the world, will.</p>
          <p>Although Schopenhauer thinks there is no idea of beauty, Schiller clearly does. Beauty’s “supreme ideal is thus to be found in the most perfected bond and equilibrium of reality and form” (Schiller 58). The experience of this improves character due to the individual moving “from the passive state of sensation to active thinking and willing,” this “intermediate state of aesthetic freedom” is “the necessary precondition by which we alone can attain insight and conviction” (84). For Schiller, beauty is not what gives truth and duty to the physical man, “beauty provides no resultant, that it in no way becomes involved with thinking and decision-making; that it rather provides us with the capacity for both, but has nothing to do at all with the actual use of this capacity” (84). Experiencing beauty and entering the aesthetic condition allow the step to be taken into the “moral condition” (85) with far greater ease as beauty introduces form in a material way. “It is only from the aesthetic condition, and not from the physical, that the moral condition can develop” (86).</p>
          <p>There is a striking similarity between both Schiller and Schopenhauer’s conception of how an individual experiences the world before an aesthetic experience (Bishop 433). The world as representation resonates with Schiller’s “physical condition,” in which “everything that exists for him is only by virtue of the passing moment” and “in vain does nature’s rich variety pass before his sense” ( Schiller 89-90). What is not accessible for this individual is any type of fundamental knowledge. For Schiller, the fundamental knowledge an aesthetic experience can facilitate pertains to character. While for Schopenhauer, it pertains to existence. We have seen the way through which Schopenhauer’s subject leaves behind his will and enters a contemplative stilling his desire. We see in Schiller’s conception of man leaving the physical condition and entering the aesthetic condition a similar contemplation. “Once man begins to contemplate, the necessity of nature that had ruled him with undivided force in the condition of mere sensation begins to weaken” (Schiller 95). What this allows for Schiller is access to the moral condition, while for Schopenhauer access to Ideas.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most profound similarity between Schiller and Schopenhauer’s theories is their recognition of the unique humanity of an aesthetic experience. Schiller believes that beauty is a necessary condition for the existence of mankind, without it, man’s sensuous rational nature wouldn’t make sense. Schopenhauer recognizes the uniqueness of mankind’s ability to gain knowledge of the Ideas (Bishop 432) and has great reverence for the artist’s ability to communicate them. While it is the case that the function of an aesthetic experience differs between the two philosopher, they both involve the entering of a state of mind representative of contemplation and reflection. For Shiller this contemplation is character enhancing, for Schopenhauer it delivers knowledge. In either train of thought, an aesthetic experience can only benefit an individual’s existence.</p>
